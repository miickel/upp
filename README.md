#UPP

Minimal setup for rapid web devlopment. Includes Stylus (nib, rupture, jeet, autoprefixer), Pug templates, Browser-sync for live updates across browsers and Gulp to orchestrate the build and watch for file changes (automatic rebuilds).

__Disclaimer:__ This setup includes tools that I enjoy using, and is not aimed at the public. I'm not looking for pull requests, but feel free to fork the project if you would like to switch things around.

## Install

Clone and install dependencies...

1. > git clone git@github.com:miickel/upp.git
2. > cd upp
3. > npm install

## Usage

Build css and html, then start the server and watch for file changes...

2. Hack away!
